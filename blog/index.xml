To do that, Epinio relies on a set of well-established open-source components, like Tekton, a docker registry and Cloud Native buildpacks.
The latest Epinio release comes with two helm charts, one for installing just Epinio, the other installs Epinio with all dependencies configured. Look at the installation docs if you want to jump right in.</description></item><item><title>Epinio v0.2.0 Release</title><link>/blog/2021/11/epinio_release_0.2.0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/11/epinio_release_0.2.0/</guid><description>The new Epinio v0.2.0 is out and marks an important milestone.
This release adds Epinio to the Rancher UI&amp;rsquo;s dashboard, but that is not the only big change. A lot more features were added in the last nine weeks.
A future blog post might talk more about the new UI, but in short, once you installed Epinio on your cluster, it shows up automatically in Rancher&amp;rsquo;s web interface. Then you can upload your apps sources and they&amp;rsquo;ll be automatically deployed.</description></item><item><title>Ways to Install Epinio v0.1.5</title><link>/blog/2021/11/ways_to_install_epinio_v0.1.5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/11/ways_to_install_epinio_v0.1.5/</guid><description>Epinio is meant to take you from App to URL in one step. It does that by either applying buildpacks to your app, or using a pre-built docker image.
Epinio comes with a pretty sophisticated installer, that knows how to install the Epinio API server in Kubernetes and setup all the dependencies.
Installing with the CLI installer, can be as easy as running epinio install.
Helm Chart What&amp;rsquo;s new is that we packaged that installer into a Helm chart.</description></item></channel></rss>
