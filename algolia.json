Epinio’s runtime dependencies, the components, must be installed in a certain order; configuration must be applied, and you must wait for Kubernetes resources to be ready and usable. For example, pods serving admission webhooks must be up and running, SSL certificates must have been generated, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaging complex deployments is the domain of software provisioning tools like Ansible, or maybe Helmfile. Though, when using Helmfile one would have to put configuration into a separate chart and control the installation order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Epinio team ships releases, we don\u0026rsquo;t manage one infrastructure, we need an installer that works with any cluster”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe latest Epinio version (0.3.x) now ships a \u003ca href=\"https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/epinio/epinio\"\u003estandalone Epinio helm chart\u003c/a\u003e. All dependencies have been removed. Because, we just can\u0026rsquo;t tell if Epinio is installed in an existing cluster, if components should be re-used. After all, how many cert-manager installations do you need in your production cluster? Indeed, one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t care, you\u0026rsquo;re using a fresh cluster, or a local cluster (like k3s, \u003ca href=\"https://rancherdesktop.io/\"\u003eRancher Desktop\u003c/a\u003e). This is also the case for our CI, when we test Epinio, we spin up a cluster and deploy the standard set of components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that case, we have another chart, the \u003ca href=\"https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/epinio/epinio-installer\"\u003eEpinio installer chart\u003c/a\u003e. The new installer, used in that chart, takes a manifest and deploys all listed dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the installer is kept simple on purpose, as we consider it more of an internal tool, it can update existing deployments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also doesn\u0026rsquo;t take ownership of the components. Most dependencies are helm charts. When problems arise, like temporary download errors, these can be fixed with helm directly. E.g., by doing a \u003ccode\u003ehelm rollback\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously you had to uninstall first, then re-install all dependencies, now you can just run the installer again, as it\u0026rsquo;s much more idempotent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"use-case-faster-installation-on-rancher-desktop\"\u003eUse case: Faster Installation on Rancher Desktop\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re deploying Epinio in RD, you might want to skip Linkerd.

It’s easier for the team to test different components. For example, we\u0026rsquo;re looking forward to trying Nginx instead of Traefik as an ingress. Maybe, all we have to do is switch the manifest to Nginx, without recompiling!?\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":1642032e3,"description":"","dir":"blog/2022/1/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":600,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642178584,"objectID":"14ba8b5aff19aa73a13266c8e0ae281d","permalink":"/blog/2022/1/installing_epinio_and_dependencies/","postref":"14ba8b5aff19aa73a13266c8e0ae281d","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","readingtime":3,"relpermalink":"/blog/2022/1/installing_epinio_and_dependencies/","section":"blog","summary":"Epinio is meant to put your application on Kubernetes with one command, without any prior Kubernetes knowledge.
